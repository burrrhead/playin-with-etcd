# playin-with-etcd

This is a very simple set of files for playing with etcd

My environment is a windows 10 box.  You will need the following installed on your windows box.

Vagrant - http://www.vagrantup.com
Virtual Box - http://www.virutalbox.org
Python3 - https://www.python.org

I also use x410 which is a windows 10 x server which can be purchased from the Mircrosoft store.  This isn't necessary, but kind of fun.

clone this report into a directory on your windows box and cd to that directory
